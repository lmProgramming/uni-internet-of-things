# Internet of Things

Here is the code related to all "Internet of Things" PWr laboratories, except the final project [Auction System](https://github.com/lmProgramming/project-iot-auction).

Arduino was lab01 to lab06, and Raspberry PI was lab07 to lab011, after which in a team of 4 we completed [Auction System](https://github.com/lmProgramming/project-iot-auction) using Raspberry PI

## Interesting projects

1. Arduino

    - lab05 - multi layer menu controlling leds, temperature readings etc., all displayed on an Arduino display
    - lab06 - weather station with my ButtonHandler library

2. Raspberry PI

    - lab10 - rfid card reader, used later in [Auction System](https://github.com/lmProgramming/project-iot-auction) project
    - lab11 - mqtt receiver and sender, later improved in [Auction System](https://github.com/lmProgramming/project-iot-auction)
